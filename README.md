# portfolio1.0

It is a portfolio website about me. It contains my information. 
It contains various sections such as Home, About me, Skills, Progress in skills, Achievements.
While making this portfolio, I have primarily used HTML and CSS and have used a little bit of javascript in the form of jquery. I have also included some links of the google fonts in the style.css file and have also used the icons available on the boxicons website.
I have made this website by learning online through the youtube tutorials and documentations available on W3Schools. 
There is also the use of many animations and hover transitions in the website
